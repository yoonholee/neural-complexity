Neural Complexity (NC) is a neural network which predicts the generalization gap of other networks.



## 1D Regression Experiments
The code inside `1d_regression/` is orgnized as follows.
- `run.py` : Main entry point. Implements MemoryBank and NC's specific training loop. Run with `python run.py --OPTIONS`
- `model/` : Contains definition of the NC network, along with parallelized task learners.
- `data/` : Sinewave data generator
